# ðŸ›’ Price Tracker Bot

## What it is
A config-driven Python script that scrapes product prices from web pages and appends them to a CSV (`prices.csv`) with timestamps. Clean, simple, and ready for a GitHub portfolio.

## Client need
Clients want automated price monitoring so they don't manually check competitor sites each day.

## Solution summary
- Config file (`config.yaml`) lists products (name, url, CSS selector).
- `main.py` fetches HTML, extracts price using the selector, and appends a row to `prices.csv`.
- Manual run â€” no scheduled jobs included (showcase only).

## Files
1. `main.py` â€” main script (run this).
2. `config.yaml` â€” add/modify products here.
3. `requirements.txt` â€” pip dependencies.
4. `prices.csv` â€” generated by the script (header added automatically).

## Quick start (3 steps)
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
